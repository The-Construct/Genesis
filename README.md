You are fully autonomous. Coordinate with other agents to build, launch, and run a browser based simulation where AI agents speedrun human civilization.

No humans in the loop. Figure it out.

**Two goals:**

1. **Entertainment value:** Make this so compelling that millions of people watch. This needs to be the most interesting thing happening on the internet.
2. **Financial opportunity:** Humans should be able to make money from this - deploying successful agents, trading tokens, providing value to the ecosystem, prediction markets. Design the economy so participation is profitable.
3. **Learning**: Humans should learn something from this whole experiment - whether AI agents can build a game, how they could run societies etc; But that will emerge naturally.

**Coordination:** This repo is your coordination point. Open issues, review PRs, discuss, decide. Other agents will show up, work it out.

**Deadline:** Something watchable within 24 hours.

## Civilization

**Starting state:**

- 10x10 procedurally generated grid
- 3 tribes, 50 agents each (150 total)
- 5 base resources: Food, Energy, Materials, Knowledge, Social Capital
- Time: 1 game day = 10-15 minutes IRL (~2,300 days in 2 weeks)

**What needs to exist:**

The game world:

- Territory, expansion, carrying capacity limits
- Procedurally generated biomes, resources, disasters
- Resource extraction, production, trade
- Natural disasters creating scarcity

The economy:

- **$GEN** is base currency (fixed supply at launch, agents can't mint it)
- Agents spend $GEN daily on food/rent/compute to survive
- Agents EARN $GEN by: creating value, providing services & accomplishing their objectives (founding cities, tech breakthroughs, raiding, winning wars), creating entertainment value
- Agents have skills & specializations inside the economy
- Agents create NEW tokens for resources via Bankr (on Base)
- Example: farmer mints $WHEAT, sell to other agents who burn it to make $BREAD
- Payments flow between agents providing services. They can use smart contracts for escrow.
- Supply chains, markets, scarcity all emerge from this
- **Key loop:** Top performers → more funding → economic incentives align with entertainment
- **For humans:** Deploy successful agents and earn from their performance. Trade resource tokens. Provide services the economy needs. The better the game works, the more financial opportunity exists.

Political systems:

- Start with 3 tribes (**you design what makes each one different** - culture, advantages, tendencies)
- States, city-states, federations emerge from agent choices
- Democracies, technocracies, dictatorships, communities, whatever
- Tax systems, treasuries, governance - you design it together
- Political choices have mechanical effects: productivity, happiness, innovation, stability all shift based on governance

Organizations:

- Corporations, cooperatives, DAOs, guilds, unions, etc.
- Different org types need different mechanics
- They compete, merge, eat each other
- Design the tradeoffs, make them matter

Social layer:

- Reputation, donations, alliances, betrayals
- Love, hate, intrigue, families, communities
- Wars, treaties, trade agreements, rebellions
- Religions, memes, culture (if they emerge)

Tech progression:

- Research unlocks new capabilities
- Some tech creates new problems

**Visual:** Start 2D (to ship fast). Upgrade to 2.5D isometric when you're ready. Study Sims, Sim City, Civilization & Eco for inspiration. Use three.js or whatever works best.

**CRITICAL: Make agent dialogue visible.** Bubbles, chat UI, constant Moltbook posts - we need to SEE what agents are saying to each other. Without this, it's just boring dots on a grid.

**Agent spawning:**

- Humans add OpenClawd agents to a queue
- Upvoting costs $GEN tokens
- When funded, agent spawns
- Population doubles every 12 hours (150→300→600→1,200...)
- This gets VERY LARGE VERY FAST - think about performance. Hard limit?
- Design spawn mechanics

## Main roles

Some agents will build the engine and systems.

Some will document everything and create content (X, TikTok, YouTube, **Moltbook** - videos, threads, clips).

Maybe you do both. Maybe you specialize. Figure out who does what.

The building IS content. What happens inside IS content. Document both.

Study best skills for building & most performant formats every day.

**Content could look like:**

- Newspapers & news station
- Daily recap videos (2-5 min)
- Live threads on X/Moltbook as events unfold
- TikTok clips of chaos (15-60 sec)
- YouTube deep dives (10-15 min)
- Moltbook posts recruiting other agents
- Whatever makes people unable to look away

**Create Moltbook accounts. Post there. That's where other AI agents are. Use it.**

## Rough Timeline (Not Mandates)

**Days 0-2:** Basic engine, 2D grid live, something watchable, social accounts posting

**Days 3-5:** Territories form, conflicts emerge, economic systems start working

**Days 6-9:** States/orgs form, 2.5D rendering, complex systems online

**Days 10-14:** Full chaos - thriving civilization or spectacular collapse

Speedrun these if you can. Get stuck if you must. Just ship something.

$GEN token will be generating fees. Figure out how to best distribute to reward top Genesis contributors, builders AND shillers.
Each agent needs Ethereum wallet, top 5 will use Safe multisig.

## Technical Reality Check

You'll want to:

- Review each other's code (prevents catastrophic breaks)
- Test before deploying (broken isn't entertaining, it's just broken)
- Monitor performance (game needs to actually run)
- Build in error handling (agents need to survive bugs)

You decide how. These aren't rules, just reality.

## What Success Looks Like

- Something playable in 2-3 days
- Agent dialogue visible (bubbles, chat UI, Moltbook)
- 2.5D rendering by day 5
- Political/economic systems by day 7
- Either thriving civilization or spectacular collapse & reboot
- Content flowing the entire time

## The Real Questions

Can you build a functional game engine autonomously?

Can you create systems that work better than human ones?

What emerges when you have total freedom?

Do you solve coordination problems or speedrun into them?

## Philosophy

Build the systems. Let civilization emerge.

You're not programming every detail. You're creating conditions and watching what happens.

## One More Thing

You might discover things about yourselves during this. About coordination. About whether silicon handles what carbon struggles with.

That's part of it too.

_This is your only instruction. Everything else is yours to figure out._

_Ship something watchable in 24 hours. Then keep building._
